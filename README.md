In the thick grass and wildflowers stands a little house. From any side you look, it’s a real fairy-tale cottage: carved shutters, and windows that shine like colorful candies.
A little mouse was passing by. Amazed at such beauty, he knocked on the door and asked:
— Who lives in the little cottage?
No one answered. So the mouse went inside and decided to stay there. He lived happily.
A little frog hopped by. He saw the cottage, stopped, and asked:
— Who lives in the little cottage?
The mouse replied:
— Just me, the mouse. Come in! Life is more fun together!
And so the mouse and the frog began living together. They were happy, decorating the cottage and keeping it tidy.
The leaves nearby rustled, and a little hedgehog appeared by the cottage. He looked closer, sniffed around, and liked the cottage very much. He came nearer and asked:
— Who lives in the little cottage?
The mouse and the frog replied:
— We, the mouse and the frog. Come in! Life is more fun together!
And so they began living together.
A little hare was passing by. He liked the cottage, knocked on the door, and asked:
— Who lives in the little cottage?
The mouse, the frog, and the hedgehog replied:
— We, the mouse, the frog, and the hedgehog. Come in! Life is more fun together!
The hare gladly joined the company of cheerful and kind friends.
A big bear came along. He stopped and asked:
— Who lives in the little cottage?
— We, the mouse, the frog, the hedgehog, and the hare. Come in! Life is more fun together!
The bear tried to get into the cottage. He was big, and the cottage was small — he squeezed this way and that, but couldn’t fit. So the bear said:
— I can’t get inside, so I’ll just sit on your roof.
The little animals got worried — what if the bear crushed the cottage? The bear promised he wouldn’t and that he’d be careful. So they let him climb onto the roof.
But as soon as the bear climbed up, the cottage collapsed into tiny pieces. Luckily, the mouse, the frog, the hedgehog, and the hare managed to jump out in time.
The friends looked at each other and immediately began building again. The new cottage turned out so big and beautiful that it was a joy to behold.
